    "Infographics and Artificial Intelligence: AI Infographic Generator Tools that Work\n",
    "Businesses have so many reasons to increase productivity without overloading employees. Firms in every market and industry are up against more competition every day. Skilled personnel are in high demand, so unhappy workers can usually find alternative employment quickly. Plus, customers and clients expect fresh, high-quality content they can engage with as often as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relatable blog posts, witty social media posts, and regular newsletters are all essential for retaining brand visibility. But have you considered the importance of infographics? You probably already know that visual content is highly impactful — the adage “A picture tells a thousand words” is well-known for a reason, after all. Psychology backs this up. Visuals can improve learning and information retention by a stunning 400%.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you pair this with the fact that effective customer education can increase the value of a customer by 19%, it’s clear that infographics could help businesses win in a big way. How can you add another content type to your strategy and retain or even improve your overall business productivity? With a helping hand from AI infographic generator tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "What Are AI Infographic Generator Tools?\n",
    "You have, no doubt, heard a lot about generative AI over the last few months. ChatGPT took the world by storm at the end of 2022. While it’s now been surpassed in technical ability by GPT-4, it’s still a very popular tool for content creation of all types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many AI-powered tools have found success off the back of ChatGPT’s limelight. Generative AI is now used to generate images, text, and even code for numerous use cases. While the most obvious use for AI might seem like blog posts and articles, AI actually struggles to make long-form content engaging without high levels of editing and customization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where AI shines is in short-form content. We’re talking photo captions, social media snippets, and, of course, infographic text. AI can also generate images, so there’s plenty of scope to create tools that output on-brand imagery with text that provides real value to viewers. AI infographic generator tools do just that, either as stand-alone products or as part of a larger suite of content creation solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Infographics are so Important\n",
    "An infographic is a form of data visualization. Data visualization is a way to present data using graphics, charts, graphs, Venn diagrams — any method other than basic text or numbers. The word itself is a snazzy portmanteau of “information” and “graphic,” which is a clear signpost for what your visuals should provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data visualization is essential because there’s no guarantee that every visitor to your blog, website, or social media account will understand the data in its raw form. Lists of numbers aren’t generally appealing to most people. A long article on a topic might be fascinating, but pulling out the key facts and displaying them visually is much more attractive, easier to digest, and, more importantly, shareable.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Quick Breakdown of the Benefits of Infographics\n",
    "So many content marketers rely on infographics because they:\n",
    "\n",
    "         Make compelling stats and figures accessible to all\n",
    "         Engage with a wider audience\n",
    "         Encourage buying decisions by delivering information faster\n",

    "What Makes a Good Infographic?\n",
    "Whether you’re plugging your data into AI infographic generator tools or painstakingly handcrafting each one, it’s good to know what makes the best graphics stand out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clarity\n",
    "Busy, cluttered infographics won’t hook viewers and encourage them to just scroll on by. Keep the information minimal, concise, and easy to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "Focus\n",
    "Infographics should deal with a single topic. Trying to cram multiple talking points into a single visual element means it won’t get shared, as its relevance won’t be clear. It’s also a good idea to consider your target audience. Are you trying to reach corporate B2B decision-makers or Gen Z Instagram users? Pick your focus and your audience, and stick to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Branding\n",
    "Make sure your brand kit is in order before you start creating dozens of infographics. We’re talking brand colors, fonts, logos, and taglines — anything that drives brand recognition or is part of your brand messaging framework should be evident in your visual marketing assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "AI Infographic Maker Basics\n",
    "Choosing AI infographic tools can be tricky if you don’t know what to look for. You want great visuals, but you probably also want a tool that can handle making your dry data digestible and even fun. Some tools only provide visuals. Others use pre-made templates and offer AI functions for text generation. Still others only generate text, which is ideal if you already have your own branded infographic templates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decide what you need from an infographic generator, and that will help you choose the right one. Check if you can get the images in png or jpg format and which of these your IT team or website administrator prefers. Look out for free versions, and when signing up for premium options, ensure they actually fit your business needs before committing to spending.\n",

    "10 of the Best AI Infographic Generator Tools and Infographic Text Generators\n",
    "To help you pick the right AI infographic generator tools, we’ve brought together 10 popular choices that all have slightly different features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Appy Pie Design\n",
    "From pie charts to timelines, Appy Pie Design has templates for just about any type of infographic. It’s part of the Appy Pie no-code development suite of products, but this platform is solely for AI-powered design.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a free version which is limited to four designs, and pricing for unlimited plans starts at $6 a month. In addition to infographics, the design tools support GIF creation and editing, photo editing, and unlimited use of clipart. This gives amateur designers plenty of opportunities to get creative, plus the generative AI is on hand to create completely new images when required. There’s also an AI font generator and logo generator, which could help businesses early in their branding journeys.\n",
    "\n",
    "As Appy Pie Design is purely graphical, users need to input their own text or use a separate text generator to complete infographics using this site.\n",
    "\n",
    "Venngage\n",
    "Venngage’s tagline is “Not a designer? No problem,” and that sums up the ethos here. This online infographic maker offers a ton of free resources, templates, and even AI-generative content for almost any use case you can think of.\n",
    "\n",
    "For customizable infographics, Venngage allows users to input their own data, which it then transforms into a smart visual based on the chosen template. The system cheerily urges you to “Sign up for free!” but like many larger suites of tools, the free infographic maker is limited and only allows you to produce five designs. Having said that, pricing starts at $10 a month, so Venngage could be a budget-friendly option for custom AI-generated infographics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Canva\n",
    "Canva is a super popular design tool aimed at creators, entrepreneurs, and businesses that might not have traditional design experience. This makes it ideal for content marketers looking to create their own infographics. It’s packed full of templates, graphics, and even royalty-free photos.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also recently upgraded to include AI-powered design tools, including Magic Design and Magic Write. Magic Design allows you to upload your own visuals or presentations, which the platform uses to generate completely custom designs. Magic Write complements this by generating captions based on prompts or data you provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Canva is probably one of the best options for custom infographics because it empowers non-designers with limited experience to produce stunning visuals. Canva does have a limited free option plus several paid plans that are reasonably budget-friendly. Prices currently start at $12.95 a month.\n",
    "\n",
    "Easel.ly\n",
    "Businesses that need to convey ideas visually can use Easel.ly (or just Easelly) to make this happen. The platform offers graphic design services for infographics, logos, presentations, and even business cards. Users can hire a graphic designer or start with the user-friendly interface. You’re presented with a blank page and a few options on the left that grant access to hundreds of graphics and templates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying AI is more subtle with Easelly’s infographic creator. It helps optimize design elements, making layout suggestions that improve visuals rather than generating them from scratch. Easelly offers a range of packages, including a student deal at just $3 a month. Business packages start at $5 a month, making this another potentially affordable option.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adobe Express — Previously Adobe Spark\n",
    "Adobe Spark was Slate was Voice and is now part of Adobe Express. This is an all-in-one design suite that makes eye-catching visuals accessible to non-designers. The suite includes Adobe Firefly AI, which allows users to generate art, graphics, and even visuals for animations at the click of a button.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because it’s part of Adobe’s larger range of creative products, existing users can import their Photoshop or Illustrator files. There’s also the possibility to create brand kits, so any infographics you create always use your company colors, fonts, and other brand identifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s a great time to sign up for Adobe Express because it’s currently still in beta testing, presumably to check the efficacy of the AI tools. This means many of the graphic design features are free to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are over 800 pre-built templates for infographics, from basic timelines to more complex workflows. You can use Adobe's generative AI to create the entire infographic, but you have to create the text yourself. If you let the AI do the text, it’s just garbled nonsense. However, the system produces some neat visuals, so if you have access to a decent AI text generator, you could combine the two tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Infographic Ninja\n",
    "This infographic generator requires a subscription, but you can try it absolutely free. The free download has a watermark, so it's unusable. However, it’s fine to check out the possibilities of this app. The interface here is really simple. You simply fill out an online form with what you want your infographic to be about. You can add up to five questions you want the infographic to answer, then either plug in that data yourself or get the AI to generate new text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add in your company name, logo, and title, and the AI generates a whole new infographic in about 30 seconds. The speed and accuracy of the app are impressive, but it’s a little limited in that it only allows for five talking points in question format. It’s part of the Outline Ninja platform, an SEO solution focused on increasing website traffic and SERP rankings. Users can start a trial for $1 but must contact the software developer for full pricing info.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scripted\n",
    "Scripted is the only content generation platform that utilizes both human and AI content writing. Human subject matter experts (SMEs) from dozens of industries handle anything that must be carefully fact-checked or dealt with in a sensitive manner. AI empowers writers to work smarter, matches businesses with the best content creators, and even helps create content briefs or source keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first time, however, Scripted is offering a free, AI-only starter package — ideal for content marketers looking for text for infographics. This service is perfect for companies that already have their own branding and imagery and just need concise, on-point facts and figures to make their infographics pop. Use cases could include visuals for blog posts, summaries of an article in a few key points for a highly shareable Instagram post, or enhancing marketing emails so that they actually get read.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bonus of Scripted’s free AI offering is that it’s also ideal for social media posts, blog idea generation, and even ad copy. It’s a great all-in-one content generation solution for businesses looking for multiple ways to boost productivity and customer engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Completely Free AI Text Generation for Infographics and More\n",
    "If you have an in-house graphic designer or you're handy with Canva or similar apps, you might only need AI to handle the writing aspects of your infographics. If that’s the case, you’re better off choosing one of the AI-powered text generators, like Scripted. You can have your text ready to embed into your graphics in a matter of seconds, and there’s no cap on how many words you can generate — your business data is your only limitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scripted also offers world-class customer support, and you have the peace of mind that it’s the go-to content solution for multiple international companies. When you or your content marketing team run out of ideas for blog posts, Scripted’s AI can generate dozens of ideas almost instantly. Likewise, if you have a great blog post or LinkedIn post but want a catchy title or subheadings, AI is your friend. Plus, if you decide you need more in-depth, human-written content, you’re already in the right place.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need AI-generated graphics, take a look at some of the other options on our list, like Adobe Spark. These tools can generate anything from a simple infographic-style background to themed text. Just make sure you’re being consistent with your branding and use tools like in-app brand kits to maximize the impact of your infographics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The National Bureau of Economic Research recently reported that using generative AI increased productivity by at least 14%. Take advantage of the possibilities by exploring how AI can help your business with visual and written content.\n",
